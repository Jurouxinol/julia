<h3 id="overall">Overall</h3>

<p>During my internship, I worked especially with the audition and migration of components to the Design System to Figma. Besides that, I worked on different products that included the My Vodafone App and Desktop, Vodafoneâ€™s website, and E-shop. Sadly due to the NDA, Iâ€™m not allowed to share specific aspects of my designs, but Iâ€™d love to share my learnings through this amazing experience.</p>

<h4 id="maximize-efficiency-and-utilize-resources">Maximize efficiency, and utilize resources.</h4>

<p>I came across the concept of how having a consistent Design System can maximize efficiency, however, I have never applied these concepts. AfterÂ <strong>familiarizing myself with our design guidelines, I started a journey on how to create flexible and efficient components.</strong>Â Having a consistent Design System, helped me to focus on usersâ€™ needs. I became immensely more efficient and produced better work. Being able to catch up on othersâ€™ work made me not only understand the importance of a good Design System, but also a better team player.</p>

<h4 id="adapt-your-speech-and-communicate-complex-ideas">Adapt your speech and Communicate complex ideas</h4>

<p>The scope of the internship was quite large. Because of that, I had to communicate with different types of stakeholders. This challenged me toÂ <strong>learn how to communicate complex ideas</strong>Â into easily understandable concepts and adapt my storytelling based on my audience.</p>

<h4 id="get-out-of-your-comfort-zone">Get out of your comfort zone</h4>

<p>During the first weeks, I felt like I was getting lost in the chaos of such a fast-paced environment. Besides the internship, I was also taking a post-graduation course which filled my nights. Iâ€™ve always tried toÂ <strong>keep an open mind and a positive attitude</strong>. So, by the end of the first month, I was feeling much more integrated into the team, motivated, and much less tired.</p>
