**Duration**: 6 months

**Role**: UX Design Intern at Consumer Business Unit - Tribe Digital Channels.

### Overall

During my internship, I worked especially with the audition and migration of components to the Design System to Figma. Besides that, I worked on different products that included the My Vodafone App and Desktop, Vodafone’s website, and E-shop. Sadly due to the NDA, I’m not allowed to share specific aspects of my designs, but I’d love to share my learnings through this amazing experience.

### My biggest learnings 

#### Maximize efficiency, and utilize resources.

I came across the concept of how having a consistent Design System can maximize efficiency, however, I have never applied these concepts. After **familiarizing myself with our design guidelines, I started a journey on how to create flexible and efficient components.** Having a consistent Design System, helped me to focus on users' needs. I became immensely more efficient and produced better work. Being able to catch up on others' work made me not only understand the importance of a good Design System, but also a better team player.

#### Adapt your speech and Communicate complex ideas

The scope of the internship was quite large. Because of that, I had to communicate with different types of stakeholders. This challenged me to **learn how to communicate complex ideas** into easily understandable concepts and adapt my storytelling based on my audience.

#### Get out of your comfort zone

During the first weeks, I felt like I was getting lost in the chaos of such a fast-paced environment. Besides the internship, I was also taking a post-graduation course which filled my nights. I've always tried to **keep an open mind and a positive attitude**. So, by the end of the first month, I was feeling much more integrated into the team, motivated, and much less tired.
