**Duration:** 3 months

**Expertise:** UX/UI Design

**Tools:** Figma

### Project Overview

The case study presented here was **my first UX case study** and was developed during the UX Design course at Awari, mentored by [Veronica Sartori](https://www.linkedin.com/in/veronica-sartori/?original_referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Egoogle%2Ecom%2F&originalSubdomain=br)

The choice of topic came from the observation of the behavior of vegetarians and vegans, as well as their cooking and shopping habits and how it affects their lives. Thus, ***Achados Veganos*** was born: a collaborative platform that helps users discover vegan products. Below, you will read the complete description of how the product was conceived, with a step-by-step analysis of all the Design processes adopted, ending with a high-fidelity navigable prototype.

### Evidence For The Problem

**The vegan market is booming.** According to the [Vegan Food Global Market Report 2021](https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/vegan-market-global-report-2020-30-covid-19-growth-and-change), it is expected to grow by $1.33 billion in 2021. Google AdWords data shows that the number of related searches grew 47% in 2020 compared to the previous year. In addition, from 2015 to 2020, this increase was over 2000% in global searches, according to [research developed by the company Thorthful](https://www.portalveg.com.br/noticias/veganismo/buscas-no-google-por-comida-vegana-crescem-mais-de-2000-em-cinco-anos/). According to [Baum+Whiteman's](https://a0193a7b-04c0-45e2-b939-b1033d2f1ed3.filesusr.com/ugd/0c5d00_22b94849e85e4be78675ff3e5c806f43.pdf) 2021 trend report, which predicts which foods and beverages are at the highest in 2021, “vegan and vegetarian product sales are skyrocketing” (free translation).

Despite being a growing market, these consumers still face several problems, and, according to a survey by [Faunalytics](https://faunalytics.org/a-summary-of-faunalytics-study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/), **around 84% abandon this way of life**. This study presents several reasons people abandon veganism and why they would consider trying again, and food is a major factor. People who abandoned veganism/vegetarianism were mostly dissatisfied with their food, and food would be a decisive factor to return.

## Discovery

### Research Strategy

To better understand my audience and current scenario, I used the following research methods:

- Competitor analysis
- Quantitative survey
- Qualitative interview

#### Competitors Analisys 

The main findings were:

- Most apps don't have a Portuguese version.
- Don't work well and that's why there are a lot of negative comments on the ratings. 
- Don't have data on national brands, which makes it difficult to search for products.
- Very focused on just one segment. Some apps have a feature to search for products, however, they only cover cosmetics or food.

#### Quantitative Survey

For this stage, I created a questionnaire that had 206 responses, leading to a confidence level of 85% with a margin of error of 5%. 

Some interesting data:

- 72% want to become vegan
- 36% said that having the information faster and more concentrated could make their life easier
- 92% said that they use Google to find information
- The biggest difficulty pointed out was "food" followed because the information is very dispersed

#### Qualitative Interviews

After gathering the data acquired in the quantitative survey, I interview 6 people: 1 vegan, 1 vegetarian, 2 ovolactovegetarians, and 2 flexitarian/sympathizers. The interview took about 30min and was done by video.

Key Insights:

- "My process of becoming a vegan was very natural and in my time." **-A.F.**
- "Sometimes it takes me hours to find information about some products." **-L.M.**
- "I look for information on blogs, but I don't trust it too much." **-L.A.**
- "I don't think I have enough information to say that I'm vegan." **-A.L.**
